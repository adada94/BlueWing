BlueWing password database storage in C. This is a prototype password storage software that allows you to enter your passwords for various websites and other applications. The user should be to enter their various passwords into the database. From there, the user should be able to access their passwords in an ever expanding list that classifies their website data into catagories such as 'arts', 'technology', etc. This will be deployed on the iPhone and iPad first, and later will be deployed on Rasberry Pi as well as other popular platforms. The process is slow, but it will gain momentum over time.
